First part confirmed (Same for LSTM and CNN)

Second part:
- Dataset same format : Corpus, train, dev, test

Model:
1. Encoder (Same as first part, to get hidden layer representation of questions)
2. Domain classifier (NEW)



Training made up of 2 components:
A. --- "Direct Transfer"
Same procedure, q --> p+, p-, p-- ... (tuples of 21 elements), TRAIN ON UBUNTU dataset itself
Want generality so will evaluate on ANDROID dataset ==> Need to retrain from scratch on UBUNTU and evaluate each epoch on ANDROID for hyperparam tuning (backprop also?)

B. --- "Domain Adaptation"
Feedforward neural network
h(q) --> id for 20 qs from Ubuntu (Label 0)
h(q') --> id for 20 qs from Android (Label 1)



Detailed procedure 
1. Get all q from UBUNTU, build tuples, similarity matrix, cosine similarity, multi-margin loss

2. Randomly pick 20 examples from UBUNTU and assign label 0, 20 examples from ANDROID and assign label 1
3. Get hidden layer for each q from 2 and feed to FEED FORWARD NEURAL NET and do softmax to get label prediction
4. Have target of labels ready and use BINARY CROSS ENTROPY LOSS module from pytorch for loss
5. So have TWO LOSSES (from multi-margin L1 and binary-cross-entropy L2)
6. Sum up the losses and call backwards (Not simple sum but rather do: L1 - lambda (L2), where lambda is a hyperparameter)
8 Have 2 optimizers in all
7. Then do .backward() for model



Some notes:
- Randomize the 20-20 examples each epoch (for 
- glove dataset
- lambda [1e-3 1e-7]
- bidirectional

- BM25 (Leucene)

TODO:
Everything ready except:
- Implementation of baselines
- feeding stuff to metrics.py DONE
